<p># US Road Accidents Analysis</p>

<p>This repository contains code and analysis for exploring and visualizing the US road accidents dataset. The dataset provides detailed information about accidents that occurred on US roads, including various attributes such as location, weather conditions, severity, and more.</p>

<p>## Dataset</p>

<p>The dataset used for this analysis is the [US Accidents dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle. It includes data on accidents that occurred in the United States. The dataset is in CSV format and is loaded using the Pandas library for data analysis.</p>

<p>## Code</p>

<p>The analysis and visualization code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains step-by-step code snippets for performing data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis. It utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.</p>

<p>The code performs the following tasks:</p>

<p>1. Data Initialization &amp; Download: Loads the dataset using Pandas and explores the data columns.<br>
2. Data Preparation and Cleaning: Checks for missing or incorrect values, removes columns with more than 25% missing data, and cleans boolean columns.<br>
3. Exploratory Analysis and Visualization: Analyzes various aspects of the dataset, including city-wise accidents, accidents by time (weekly, yearly, and daily), data sources, states with the highest number of accidents, temperature distribution, weather conditions, and severity of accidents.</p>

<p>## Results</p>

<p>The analysis provides insights into different aspects of road accidents in the United States. Some key findings from the analysis include:</p>

<p>- City Analysis: The analysis explores the distribution of accidents across different cities, identifying cities with high and low accident rates.<br>
- Time Analysis: The analysis examines accidents by time, including daily, weekly, and yearly trends. It highlights peak accident hours and variations on weekends and weekdays.<br>
- Source Analysis: The analysis investigates the sources of the accident data, indicating that the data primarily comes from sources like Bing and MapQuest.<br>
- State Analysis: The analysis visualizes the number of accidents for each state in the US, highlighting states with the highest accident rates.<br>
- Temperature Analysis: The analysis explores the distribution of accidents based on temperature and identifies the most common temperature range during accidents.<br>
- Weather Condition Analysis: The analysis categorizes weather conditions and examines their impact on accidents, highlighting the most common weather conditions during accidents.<br>
- Severity Analysis: The analysis explores the severity levels of accidents, indicating the distribution of accidents across different severity categories.</p>

<p>The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents in the US and helps in understanding accident patterns and trends.</p>

<p>## Usage</p>

<p>To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:</p>
