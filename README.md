# USA Accident EDA
In my learning phase, this was one of my first efforts. This is an EDA performed on USA Accident Data from 2016 to 2023, including millions of data entries and 43 features. 
I conducted EDA on ten aspects that I considered were critical to understanding the data, which led to some of the conclusions based on my knowledge in traffic engineering.
