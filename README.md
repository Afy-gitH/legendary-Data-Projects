# legendary-Data-Projects
One of my first projects, in my learning phase. This is an EDA done on USA Accident Data ranging from the years 2016 - 2023, with millions of data entries and 43 features. I wish I could so ML Algorithm pipelines on this one, it has beatiful data. But was cut short on my computing limitations.
I have done EDA on 10 features that I felt were important to understand the data, that has lead to some of the conclutions with my background in traffic regulations.
